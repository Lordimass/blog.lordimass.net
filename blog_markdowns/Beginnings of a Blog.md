# Beginnings of a Blog | 28/11/24

I'd like to start a blog so I can ramble about things that I'm doing and document my thoughts without sounding like a self-centred ass on my Discord server shouting into the void of #general.

I'll probably have this site slowly evolve, as I'm writing this its in a *very* raw form, the only way to actually read this blog is by viewing a markdown file. In the end, I'd like a nice looking site which will read these markdown files and dynamically convert them to HTML so that they can be shown correctly on the site while still allowing me to write them in markdown. My main reasoning for that is that it's much easier to write markdown than HTML, so I'll be more likely to actually write a post if I can do it in that easier format.

For the uninitiated, markdown is the text formatting Discord uses, so you can surround text with asterixes (\*) to do italics, and other such formatting with minimal effort. Conversely, writing posts in HTML would require properly introducing <p> tags etc to get the formatting I want. So yea, I definitely want to go with markdown for the site.

The main issue right now with doing that is that a lot of my programming time is currently occupied by renovating [reformationfundraising.com](https://reformationfundraising.com) ready for the 2025 event in February, which is getting scarily close: It's pretty much December now, which as ever will be a busy month what with my birthday, Christmas, new years etc. Then I'll only have January to prepare since the stream is on 1st February (non-official date as for now, it will almost definitely be then, but not confirming until I do official announcements :3)

The first real job for getting this little personal project of a site up and running (besides writing this initial post) is getting the subdomain published, likely at [blog.lordimass.net](https://blog.lordimass.net), I'm gonna work on that now just to get things started so I can't back out :)
