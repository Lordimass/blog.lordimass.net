# Reformation â†’ Havoc | 30/07/2025
`Hello World`!

Back in 2020 I joined a community building a Terraria mod called *Havoc*. I won't tell the whole story of that here because I've recounted it loads of times before, but cut short, a spin-off server called Havoc MC was created, which rapidly grew more active than Havoc itself. After a disagreement we ended up creating a new server which everyone transitioned to called *Reformation*, named because it was supposed to reform the rules of the previous server.

## So why the change?

This happened in September 2021, 8 months after the UK's aptly named [Brexit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit) Party (bear with me) officially renamed to *[Reform UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform_UK)*. You can probably see where this is going...

At the time I was unaware of this, partially because I was 15 years old at the time, but also because the party was largely irrelevant in UK politics after Brexit and all the while [Richard Tice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Tice) was ineffectually leading the party. Unfortunately, this nasty little wart began to grow again in 2024 before the General Election when [Nigel Farage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Farage), renowned racist, became leader of the party. He appealed to gammons well enough in that time to snag 14.29% of the vote, up 12.3% from the last election, placing the party comfortably in 3rd Place behind Labour and Conservative (the two major parties in the UK).

This is relevant of course because as this right-wing, populist, Nazi-inspired party grew, its name became ever more prominent in UK rhetoric, and having a community named so similarly as *Reformation*, I began to feel that the name was far too close for comfort. During [Reformation Fundraising](https://reformationfundraising.com/)'s 24hr Stream 2025, there were a couple of chat messages from people who had stated that they'd seen posters and adverts for the stream but almost didn't scan the QR code because the name of the group made them think that we were related to Reform UK, and that the only thing that convinced them otherwise was the charity we were supporting ([Stonewall](https://reformationfundraising.com/archive/2025)). Thankfully, the stream was still incredibly successful, and a tonne of fun, so it wasn't overall an issue. But nonetheless it started to grow more on me the need to change our name.

This is honestly only part of the reason I wanted to change it, I also just honestly did not like the name anymore, I felt like we had outgrown it and it was sort of *cringy*. With that in mind, I made the decision to start a vote to rebrand ourselves, and what better to name ourselves than where we came from, and what we kind of do as a group, pure *Havoc*.

I know the name isn't exactly free of the 'cringe' aspect I mentioned, but in my opinion, and the opinion of 77% of voters (23/30), it was better than Reformation. In fact, 93% of voters (28/30) at least agreed that we should rename, 17% (5/30) thinking that we should choose something other than Havoc. After speaking with a few people opposed to Havoc it became clear that they were not vehemently opposed to it, rather, they just thought maybe there might be something better, which is fair.

In the end though, the vote meant that the rebrand would go ahead, and as I'm writing this we're still in that in between stage, waiting to rename...

Part of that process has been creating a new logo to brand ourselves under, which has been a *process*. I've certainly got a lot better at graphic design than when I designed the Reformation Logo in March 2024 and certainly better than the logo from March 2022... which I'm just noticing literally says the word "*Reform*" on it. Oops.

That's all I've got for you on this, but I figured I'd give the full process of designing the new logo, as well as a history of Havoc/Reformation's branding throughout the years.
