# The Best Superpower | 14/12/2024
`Hello World!`

I apologise in advance for the potential lack of quality in this post, I'm absolutely exhausted right now but I had an idea for a blog post and now I have to write it :p

I'm pretty sure everybody has heard the conversation starter asking "If you could have any super power, what would it be?", or something along those lines. This often starts conversations by having each person involved explain why they think their choice gives the most power or why they wouldn't want one thing or another. For example, a common counter argument to the choice of mind control is that it wouldn't be nice to know when people are thinking negatively of you (I disagree with this anyways but there we go, that is *an* example). Basically this post is here to tell you that you're all objectively wrong and the best superpower is Complete Time Control.

Each word in that power is important, starting with the last word because I'm a rebel and I do what I want: "Control" rather than "Travel" because Time Travel implies that you can just move yourself and only yourself to other points in time, whereas control implies that you can control many things rather than just your whole self, like you may choose to slow down or speed up time. [Perchance](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/042/925/mtidea.jpg). "Time" is self-explanatory, but "Complete" is absolutely crucial to what I'm defining this imaginary super power as, it means that you are able to control the flow of time for everything, that means that you could control individual molecules of air for example.

Now this does sound pretty powerful, but why is it *the best*? Well the reason for that is because it *gives* you every other super power by extension. Lets start with the mind-reading power to begin with, how could time control possibly give you the ability to read minds? Well to show that we need an important tool which we'll continue to use to show how every other superpower is achievable, and that's Complete Position Control. Since, in this hypothetical, we have complete control of time, we by extension have control of velocity because we can (as stated in the original definition) speed up and slow down time, now if we apply this increased or reduced flow of time, that creates the effect of increased or decreased speed respectively. Then, following from that since we now have speed and time control and distance is the product of that speed and time, we must then have power of distance. Finally as a closing point on this, position is the derivative of distance, so we have Complete Position Control. To specify what this actually means, it means that we can (at will) change the position of any object

As a quick recap now, we have now extended our superpower to give us three powers:
- Complete Time Control
- Complete Speed Control
- Total Position Control

Now I think it's fair to assume that if you're able to specify the position of anything, you must be able to know *where* everything is in order for that to be true. Then, if you know where everything is, you know where every molecule in a person's brain is, which gives you the ability to tell what they're thinking. You may be asking, "But how will you know how to interpret what the molecule positions mean?", and that's the topic of the next part.

With your Complete Time Control, it's not much of a stretch to say that you have the ability to spend as much time as you want doing some activity by freezing the rest of the world, speeding up your own perception of time, then carrying out the activity. Since we can spend as much time as we want, we'll assume some "infinite" time spent on any activity of choice. In this case, the activity we want to choose is research and/or learning, so by that method, you can learn everything. If you've learnt everything, then you can *know* everything. This is otherwise known as *Omniscience*.

So, now that we have omniscience, we can apply this to our mind control problem from before to say that we can know exactly how the brain works and what different positions mean, giving us the ability to tell what that person is thinking. Alternatively we could apply our omniscience directly to just say that since we know everything, we know what everyone is thinking anyways.

Using the powers we have I'll now go through and explain how it gives us certain powers.

**Flight** - We have total position control, so we can cause ourselves to be in any position. In this case, the air.

**Invisibility** - We have total position control and omniscience. Apply the omniscience to know the configuration of everyone's brain which would lead to a lack of perception of yourself. Now apply the total position control to put their brains into this configuration

**Laser Eyes** - This one is a little more complicated... To start with we must extrapolate that we have *Total Temperature Control*: Since temperature is the average speed of the molecules which make up a substance and we have complete speed control, we can then control the temperature of any substance. Now we can apply that total temperature control to super heat the air in a beam extending from our eyes, creating a beam of plasma, with the effect of a penetrating laser beam. Alternatively, if we take the definition of laser eyes that requires an actual beam of light, we can simply apply our total position control to place photons in a position such that they beam out of our eyes.

**Superhuman Strength** - Apply our base power (Complete Time Control) to spend infinite time working out.

**X-Ray Vision** - Apply omniscience, we know everything and thus can tell what is through anything because we know what is there.

**Multi-dimensional Travel** - We'll define this power as the ability to travel between universes at will, assuming that there are infinite universes for every combination of possible outcomes. This sounds like something that easily bests me and my Total Time Control. But if we have total position control, we can rearrange the universe at will to be identical to any universe we like. Of course we can also do this instantaneously by controlling how long it may take to do that.

I may update this blog if people bring up any points which I think are worth discussing, but obviously I can't go through every power because there's a theoretical infinity of them. My theory is though that anything you can come up with can be achieved in some way as an extension of Total Time Control.
