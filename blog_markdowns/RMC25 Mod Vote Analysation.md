# RMC25 Mod Vote Analysation
`Hello World!`

Jumping straight into this one with a little backstory for those who are outside of Reformation...

Recently, I ran a Minecraft server for Reformation Minecraft titled *Reformation Minecraft Vanilla++* (Or RMC V++ for short). This server was our first real delve into how mods could affect the playstyle on RMC. We'd played with Vanilla+ mods quite extensively before this point, but only once before had we even touched content mods, and that was a very minimal scrape of the surface, with no real configuration involved in developing the pack.

This time, with RMC V++, a significant amount of effort was put into planning how the mods would interact with each other and with the community. Although it had its flaws, this server was a crucial piece of research into how we could implement mods in the future. It provided a lot of valuable information both through formal methods of data collection like the form which is the topic of this blog, and informal methods (i.e. conversation with players)

Following this server's eventual decline in player count (about two and a half weeks post-launch) I wanted to give the players some form of choice in what mods would be included in the next server, RMC25. Not all of the mods were included in this vote because many of the mods had already had decisions made. One mod in particular, *Iron's Spells and Spellbooks*, was involved in a lengthy discussion of its pros and cons for the server, if you're interested in reading that, it's available to read [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YP-V1_FOWeiYqXowqq3-3d_7hduweM-Xlg_8T4747cs/edit?usp=sharing). It was ultimately decided that Iron's would not be included in RMC25. Other mods, such as Lootr (A mod which instances loot chests per player) were universally and evidently well liked by players, so, given its uncontestedness, it seemed like a waste of time to ask for that in a more formal formal setting.

I'll go through each of the mods that were voted on one by one and comment on how surprised or unsurprised by their result I am, as well as the impact that this will have on the server. However, I will not be describing what each mod is, you can Google that yourself if you don't know :). First up, Create mod.

![Create mod, 85.7% Keep, 14.3% Remove, 7 Responses](../images/Create%20Mod%20Vote.png)

There will be a running trend throughout these results, which is that I am surprised by many of the results. I suspected that Create may have been viewed as much too modded for RMC given how game changing it is for production and automation mechanics. I think, however, that the people who do use automation are happy enough that it is a balanced mod, whereas those who don't do automation don't particularly care for it either way, and are happy to have it included.

![Create Enchantment Industry, 57.1% Keep, 42.9% Remove, 7 Responses](../images/Create%20Enchantment%20Industry%20Mod%20Vote.png)

Once again I am surprised by this result. During the runtime of RMC V++, I didn't hear a single positive comment about Enchantment Industry, in fact, I heard *only* negative comments, but it seems that may have been a vocal minority of people given this result. The trouble with Enchantment Industry is that is can make villagers obselete as a mechanic, in my personal opinion I don't think that it has too much of an impact given how far progress gated this content is. You have to get very far into Create mod to be able to use Enchantment Industry, so it's actually likely easier to set up villagers. The tradeoff of course is that it's not as good as a well done Enchantment Industry setup.

![Create Steam 'n' Rails, 57.1% Keep, 42.9% Remove, 7 Responses](../images/Create%20Steam%20n%20Rails%20Mod%20Vote.png)

Create Steam 'n' Rails was always going to be included if Create was included, so this vote was actually largely pointless. Nonetheless, I am surprised by the result being so close. The possibilities are amazing for what you can do with this mod, and specifically when applied to RMC I think it could be amazing for transport and bringing life to the world.

![Farmer's Delight, 71.4% Keep, 28.6% Remove, 7 Responses](../images/Farmer's%20Delight%20Mod%20Vote.png)

Farmer's Delight is the first unsurprising result, the mod is great and provides amazing roleplay possibilities to the server. Many people expressed that they enjoyed the mod, so I'll look forward to seeing what people do with it in RMC25

![Deeper and Darker, 33.3% Keep, 66.7% Remove, 6 Responses](../images/Deeper%20and%20Darker%20Mod%20Vote.png)

Deeper and Darker is a mod which has great potential, but it's generally pretty pretty empty in terms of content. Due to that, I'm pretty unsurprised by this result too. The mod was not enjoyable to play with and seemed to just add an extra tier of tools and armour for no good reason, without much of a unique twist. The dimension added by the mod is almost entirely devoid of content, containing only a few structures with minimal unique items, and those that are added do not function properly with the current state of the mod.

![Draconic Ascension, 71.4% Keep, 28.6% Remove, 7 Responses](../images/Draconic%20Ascension%20Mod%20Vote.png)

Back on the chain of surprising results, I fully expected a dragon fight overhaul mod such as this one to be rejected by the community. Admittedly, not many people actually experienced the content of the mod, but I believe that the the majority of the people who did participate in the fight were part of the seven people who voted on this form.

![End Remastered, 83.3% Keep, 16.7% Remove, 7 Responses](../images/End%20Remastered%20Mod%20Vote.png)

I didn't particularly have an expectation for the results of this mod, but I'm glad that it resulted in being kept. The additional challenge to get the eyes means that the dragon fight is artificially offset from the normal position in the server's life cycle, so I'm not forced to just tell people that they're not allowed to do the fight, rather, they *can't* do the fight until they have done significantly more exploration and work to get there.

![Storage Drawers, 85.7% Keep, 14.3% Remove, 7 Responses](../images/Storage%20Drawers%20Mod%20Vote.png)

I'm not sure how to feel about the results from this vote, initially I disagreed with having this mod in the game, thinking it to be too powerful for the server. However, having given it further thought, I think it's probably quite a good thing because it enables people to be more organised with their storage with much less effort than is generally required to build a mass item sorter. It functions in a similar way to Create does in that it opens up possibilities for people without having to engage in the daunting task that Redstone can present, whilst still allowing redstone to have its place on the server.

![Framed Blocks, 85.7% Keep, 14.3% Remove, 7 Responses](../images/Framed%20Blocks%20Mod%20Vote.png)

I am very surprised that so many people voted to keep this mod given how little I saw it get used. It also generally goes against a lot of the creative processes of the game in that it removes many of the restrictions which builders have. Then again, I think given that it wasn't used much, that trend may continue, and only those who are interested in engaging with the mod will actually discover the possibilities it has in the first place.

![MineColonies, 28.6% Keep, 71.4% Remove, 7 Responses](../images/MineColonies%20Mod%20Vote.png)

The result from this mod is largely unsurprising. MineColonies, although incredibly fun to play with, can be very buggy and difficult to get the colonists to do what you want them to do. Coming from a person who absolutely adores colony sims (Rimworld, Craft The World, etc.) I am glad this mod was voted to be removed. It also poses issues with abuse of its features: during the course of RMC V++ the base of one member was destroyed because they had attempted to exploit the fact that other players cannot do anything within a colony by placing a town hall block to start a colony as a sort of chunk claim, then, when I attempted to right this by deleting the colony, I screwed up and accidentally deleted half of their base because it removed all of the blocks in the colony as well as just removing that "chunk claim". Despite this, I do think that the mod is balanced because it requires a huge time investment to actually get anything out of it, and even then, it's not tonnes of resources. Despite that, it's still a valid way of automating some materials that would otherwise be very difficult or actually impossible to automate. All of this to say, I think its a fun mod, but the issues with it mean that it's not right for our server.

![Explorer's Compass, 42.9% Keep, 57.1% Remove, 7 Responses](../images/Explorer's%20Compass%20Mod%20Vote.png)
![Nature's Compass, 100% Keep, 0% Remove, 7 Responses](../images/Nature's%20Compass%20Mod%20Vote.png)

I'll handle the Explorer's Compass and Nature's Compass together, given their similarity in features. As a recap, Explorer's Compass points directly to a structure, whereas the Nature's Compass just points to a biome. The reason that the Explorer's compass was voted to be removed is likely due to one or both of the following reasons:

1. It's buggy, sometimes it won't actually point towards a structure, despite claiming that there is one at a specific location. I can only assume this is something to do with world generation *almost* putting a structure in a location (to the point where the Explorer's compass assumes that there is one there) but then for some reason or another is unable to do so, so the structure ends up not actually being there.

2. It's overpowered. When it does work, it removes the exploration aspect of the game by allowing members to go directly to the structure with little to no actual work, so the fun of finding rare structures is completely stripped by just making it "There's one here, you just have to travel 10,000 blocks to actually get to it" 

![LittlePictureFrames, 100% Keep, 0% Remove, 7 Responses](../images/LittlePictureFrames%20Mod%20Vote.png)

The result for LittlePictureFrames is completely unsurprising, the mod was used to have a lot of fun on the server, including custom try not to laugh challenges and other tomfoolery. Not much to say here other than that I'm glad to have it come to the next server!

![Geophilic, 100% Keep, 0% Remove, 7 Responses](../images/Geophilic%20Mod%20Vote.png)

Geophilic is a relatively subtle **datapack** (Outlier in that it's not actually a mod :O), I feel that the changes it makes may not have even been noticed by the majority of players, those who did, however, probably liked the subtle beauty the datapack added to the world, both of those lead to this unanimous decision to keep the datapack.

And that's all of them! I won't say here exactly what my plans are for the next server, but basically, keep an eye on [reformationfundraising.com](https://reformationfundraising.com) because the date of the next stream is also the date that the server launches :D

That's all I have to say for now, once again, thank you for reading and I'll cya all later, 

`Goodbye World!`
